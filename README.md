### Hello there, I am Carlos! :sunglasses: :palm_tree:

<br/>
<br/>

I’m a data scientist currently doing **research in prostate cancer** as part of my **PhD**. More concretely, I am working to understand the biological role of PSMA using next-generation sequencing data.

I’m continously working on improving the skills I use on a daily basis. This currently includes a diverse array of bioinformatics toolkits and technologies. Check out [my thoroughly-documented repositores](https://github.com/CarlosUziel?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=) to get a better idea of what exact languages and libraries I have built my projects with.

And don't forget to visit my [portfolio website](https://www.carlosuziel-pm.dev/)! There you will also find links to my profiles in all other platforms.
