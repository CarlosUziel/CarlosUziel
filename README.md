### Hello there, I am Carlos! :sunglasses: :palm_tree:

<br/>
 
I have been working with data of many different types for over five years. From images and tables to genomic data, I have applied statistics and machine learning in order to answer key questions in both academia and industry.

As an independent data scientist, I use data to help businesses reach their goals. Everything starts with a deep understanding of the needs and targets of my clients, from which I can craft a customised solution adapted to their budgets and timelines.

I leverage my dual background in computer science and business management, as well as the skills acquired during my PhD, to identify business needs and develop innovative solutions using state-of-the-art technologies.

Curious to know how data can be used to drive your business forward? Contact me today and letâ€™s have a call to find out.

My background and experience:
- PhD(c) in Bioinformatics, M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and B.Sc. in Computer Engineering.
- More than 5 years of experience in data analysis and machine learning in different domains.
- Focus on Python data stack, from Pandas and Numpy to PyTorch and Streamlit.
