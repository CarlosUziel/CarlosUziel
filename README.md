### Hello there, I am Carlos! :sunglasses: :palm_tree:

<br/>

Do you need to extract insights from your data? I will evaluate your data analysis needs and find the best solution for your business or research goals. No over-complicated and expensive methods when simple statistics will get you what you want in a faster and more cost-effective way.

When you decide to work with me, you can expect a thorough, reliable and responsive professional determined to drive your project forward. You will receive the personalized attention of an independent contractor. I will be your sole point of contact and be in charge of all the solutions tailored to your needs.

Hereâ€™s an example of a typical workflow to start working together:
 1. Schedule a 30-minute FREE consultation to discuss your needs. Alternatively, you can write me an email with these details instead. Additional paid consultations are also possible.
 2. When necessary, you will receive a exploratory data analysis (EDA) proposal so I can understand your data to best estimate the analysis and/or modelling efforts according to your needs. Upon completion of the EDA, you will receive a full report on your data.
 3. Then I will craft a project proposal to reach your goals. We will address all the details until we have a finalized agreement.
 4. Project starts! You will receive progress reports and/or deliverables during the execution of your project, depending on the pre-agreed conditions. You can expect quick response times (<24h) as well as timely and detailed reporting.

My background and experience:
- PhD(c) in Bioinformatics, M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and B.Sc. in Computer Engineering.
- More than 5 years of experience in data analysis and machine learning in different domains.
- Focus on Python data stack, from Pandas and Numpy to PyTorch and Streamlit.

Apart from tabular data from different domains, I also have experience processing next-generation sequencing data (e.g. RNA-Seq and DNA Methylation data)
